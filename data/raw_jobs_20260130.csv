**This is not a Canva job.** If your idea of design is copy\-pasting vintage art, slapping type on a tee, and calling it a day — this is not for you.

**The Mission**

Jordan Craig and See You in Paradise have been building strong men’s silhouettes for nearly three decades. Now we’re expanding the line with **graphics that hit just as hard as the garments themselves**.

We already have many talented apparel designers who can design beautiful jean washes and killer jackets, but we are looking to add more **top\-tier graphic designers** who can elevate tees, fleece, outerwear, and full collections with cohesive, intentional graphics.

That’s the gap. That’s the role.

We’re looking for a **real apparel graphic designer** — someone who understands how **image, type, fabric, ink, and culture** come together to make a piece hit *hard*. Someone who can build cohesive graphics from scratch, not Frankenstein layouts from Pinterest.

**What You’ll Actually Be Doing**

* Designing **original graphics and typography** for: T\-shirts, hoodies, jackets, denim, fleece, outerwear
* Creating **cohesive graphic systems**, not one\-off random hits
* Designing with **print reality in mind**:
* Understanding how **ink interacts with fabric**:
* Prepping **print\-ready files** factories and printers can actually use
* Contributing to **brand identity**, not just seasonal graphics

**What We’re Looking For**

* You **design from concept**, not from Google Images
* You understand **streetwear, men’s fashion, and culture**
* You’ve worked in **apparel**, not just digital or branding
* Expert in the printing process \- the print shop makes perfect samples with our files in one shot
* Ability to build **full graphic stories**, not isolated designs

**The Vibe**

We’re building real product, not watered\-down, suburban, safe graphics.

This is for designers who care about **taste, execution, and authenticity**.

------------------



Superette is DoorDash's award\-winning in\-house creative studio. We create work that's sharp, memorable, and part of the conversation, blurring the lines between brand and culture, storytelling and utility, entertainment and effectiveness.



We exist to build a brand people actually care about. One that shows up meaningfully across every touchpoint and earns its place in culture through creativity that hits hard and sticks. Our studio is stacked with some of the best talent in the game, and our ambition is simple: raise the bar with every brief.



In 2024, we were named the \#2 in\-house studio by The One Show and The Drum. DoorDash landed on Fast Company's Brands That Matter list, US Weekly's Top 50 Hottest Brands, and was ranked one of the Top 10 Most Creative Brands in the World by Cannes Lions. And we're just getting started.


**About the Role**
------------------



We're looking for an ideas\-first Creative Lead, Art Director background. Someone who starts with a strong concept, not just aesthetics, and takes full ownership of the work from start to finish. This is a hands\-on senior creative role for someone who wants to be in the work, not managing from the sidelines. You'll be one of the senior creatives in the studio, shaping campaigns that move fast, stand out, and leave a mark on culture.



You have a sharp eye for visual storytelling and design. You know how to define the look and feel of a campaign in a way that's both bold and cohesive. You're just as comfortable working on large\-scale productions as you are creating something powerful on your own. Big budgets aren't a requirement for you to make something great; you're proactive, hands\-on, and always pushing the work forward. You don't wait for the perfect brief; you understand the brand, spot the opportunity, and come up with smart, creative solutions that move the needle.



You embrace AI as a creative tool that expands what's possible. You'll collaborate with writers, designers, producers, and teams across Brand and Social to craft work that drives real business results while pushing creative standards forward. If you bring fresh, original ideas, obsess over craft, and want to create work people actually talk about, this role is for you.



You will report to our Creative Director of Co\-Marketing and Ads, Chris Allick, within Superette.


**You're excited about this opportunity because you will…**
-----------------------------------------------------------


* Work on projects that feel worthy of a top place in your portfolio.
* Have a lot of autonomy to run projects and grow as a leader.
* Develop campaigns with the best partners in the industry, who are all eager to work for DoorDash and help shape our brand.
* No new business pitches. No timesheets.
* Dive deep into the brand to create work that not only reaches the highest creative bar but also drives meaningful results.
* Experience a different approach to work compared to traditional advertising agencies.
* Go beyond, making ads to create experiences, content, product enhancements, and solutions that solve our audiences' real problems.
* Work at an intense pace during your day, but will have a good work/life balance
* Collaborate with a team of talented writers, art directors, designers, and social strategists who deeply understand our business and audiences.
* Fully\-remote (within the US)

**We're excited about you because…**
------------------------------------


* You've got a portfolio full of smart, well\-crafted, famous work that broke into culture.
* Proven track record in creating and leading high\-impact, award\-winning campaigns that drive brand recognition and love
* You've done TV/film that you're proud of, but you're mostly excited about big ideas regardless of the medium they live in – whether that is clever activations, social content, brand entertainment, or anything else that earns free media.
* You're amazing at your craft—an exceptional art director with a sharp eye and obsessive attention to detail. Whether it's building decks, scouting a DP, or crafting the visual identity for a campaign, you don't stop until everything is pixel\-perfect.
* Ability to push creative boundaries while maintaining high production standards and a consistent brand aesthetic.
* You're an ad nerd.
* You're proactive by nature — you don't wait to be asked, you spot opportunities and make things happen.
* You embrace change. What worked yesterday might not work today — you stay curious, adapt fast, and keep up with new tools, platforms, and creative possibilities.
* You stay on top of cultural trends, always trying to find the sweet spot where a brand connects with people's lives and interests.
* You're passionate about sports, or entertainment, or pop culture, or all of them combined.
* You don't work in isolation—you love collaborating with people from all departments in the organization.
* Bachelor's degree or equivalent experience

### **Design at Ethos**



Design at Ethos plays a meaningful role in shaping our product and customer experience end\-to\-end. We work cross\-functionally to solve hard problems, build products that matter, and raise the bar for craft in a highly regulated, decision\-heavy domain. You'll experiment, learn quickly, and help us build a stronger design practice as we grow.


### **About the Role**



We're looking for Ethos' first Design Systems Designer to build and evolve the design system that powers our customer and internal experiences.



This is a true 01 opportunity. Ethos is not yet ""design\-system mature,"" and that's exactly why this role matters: you'll help bring structure to how we design and build UI, without slowing down product teams or over\-engineering processes. You'll partner closely with Product Design, Engineering, Brand/Creative, and Content Design to create a system that helps teams move faster while improving consistency, accessibility, quality, and trust.



This role is a blend of strategy and hands\-on execution. You'll define what the system is, build it in Figma, help translate it into production\-ready components and tokens with engineering, and set the operating model that keeps it healthy as Ethos scales into its next chapter.


### **Duties and Responsibilities:**


#### **Strategy \& Foundations**


* Establish the vision, principles, and roadmap for Ethos' design system — balancing long\-term scalability with near\-term product needs.
* Audit the current system, product UI and identify the highest\-leverage opportunities to standardize patterns and reduce inconsistency.
* Define a scalable token strategy (color, typography, spacing, elevation, motion, etc.) and a clear approach to theming and brand expression across products.

#### **System Design \& Craft**


* Design, build, and maintain Figma libraries (components, styles/variables, templates, and patterns) that product teams can confidently use.
* Create high\-quality component specifications with clear interaction behavior, states, responsive guidance, and accessibility considerations (focus, keyboard, contrast, error handling, etc.).
* Ensure the system supports narrative, conversion\-driven experiences (e.g., discovery flows, applications, underwriting moments, onboarding, policy management, lifecycle touchpoints).

#### **Engineering Partnership**


* Partner with Design System / Front\-End engineers to translate the system into reusable code components and tokens (and help define component APIs that work for product teams).
* Align on workflows that keep design and code in sync (component lifecycle, versioning, release notes, deprecations).
* Drive pragmatic adoption: start where it matters most, ship iteratively, and build credibility through visible product impact.

#### **Governance, Adoption \& Enablement**


* Build documentation that is actually used: guidelines, do/don't examples, usage rationale, and decision records.
* Coach and enable partner teams (Product Design, Engineering, PM) on how to use the system effectively and when to extend it.
* Create a lightweight contribution process that enables product designers and engineers to propose, review, and add to the system.

#### **Measurement \& Iteration**


* Define what success looks like and track meaningful signals (adoption, UI consistency, reduced design/development time, accessibility improvements, fewer regressions).
* Partner with Research and Data teams where useful to connect system changes to outcomes (quality, user confidence, conversion efficiency).

### **Qualifications and Skills:**


* 7\+ years of relevant experience, with a track record of setting system strategy, driving cross\-team adoption, and raising the bar for design quality across an organization.
* Strong product design foundation with excellent visual and interaction craft — you care deeply about details and can scale that quality through systems.
* Hands\-on experience building and maintaining design systems in Figma, including component architecture, documentation, and scalable patterns.
* Strong working fluency with modern front\-end concepts (tokens, components, states, responsive behavior). You don't need to be an engineer, but you can collaborate closely with engineering and understand tradeoffs.
* Experience setting accessibility standards and shipping accessible components (WCAG\-informed practices, inclusive design thinking).
* Ability to thrive in ambiguity and build structure where it doesn't yet exist — you're pragmatic, opinionated, and iterative.
* Clear communicator who can align diverse stakeholders and influence without relying on formal authority.
* A portfolio that demonstrates end\-to\-end design system thinking and real\-world impact (adoption, quality, speed, consistency).
* Experience building design tokens pipelines and/or working with tooling like Storybook or similar component documentation environments preferred.
* Experience with video, motion, illustration/iconography, tone preferred.

OpenAI didn’t begin as a traditional company. It began as an idea: that artificial intelligence could be developed in a way that benefits everyone. As a creative team, our role is to help make sure
  
  

the work behind that idea is understood, as it leaves the lab and meets the world.
  
  

This company works at the frontier of intelligence. Like any frontier, it’s unfinished, constantly shifting, and still being explored. Our job is to stay close to that uncertainty and help shape how this story gets told, in a way that feels grounded and human. We do this through campaigns, launches, films, brand systems, and work that doesn’t fit neatly into any of those categories yet. This team is for people who want to help shape something from the beginning.
  
  

About the Role
  
  

We’re seeking a Brand Designer to define, evolve, and execute OpenAI’s visual identity across brand, marketing, and product\-led storytelling environments. This role encompasses the full scope of brand design, including shaping and maintaining core identity systems, designing high\-impact marketing and launch assets, and stewarding the consistency and quality of the brand’s visual language. In addition, the role owns how OpenAI’s product identity and UI principles extend beyond the interface into expressive brand applications.
  
  

This role sits at the intersection of product design and brand expression, ensuring that OpenAI’s interface, visual systems, and marketing materials form a cohesive and recognizable whole. You’ll design and deliver day\-to\-day brand work across campaigns, web, motion, print, and environmental touch points, while translating the product’s design language into scalable creative systems that align how the product looks, feels, and communicates both inside and outside the interface.
  
  

This role formalizes and scales a function that is already driving measurable impact by connecting the evolution of OpenAI’s UI with brand identity and marketing expression, strengthening clarity, consistency, and recognition across every touch point.
  
  

In this role, you will
  
  

Extend product design into brand expression through leading the design of marketing and communication materials that reflect the evolving product UI.
  
  

Create cohesive systems for web, animation, print, and OOH campaigns that maintain fidelity to the product’s experience.
  
  

Develop and maintain expressive UI systems by building, documenting, and evolving a shared set of design principles and components that connect brand and product.
  
  

Ensure updates to the product interface are mirrored in marketing and creative materials through clear, scalable guidelines.
  
  

Collaborate with cross\-functional partners by working closely with product design, marketing, motion, and creative teams to ensure consistency and continuity across all visual outputs.
  
  

Partner with producers, engineers, and brand designers to extend the product identity into new mediums.
  
  

Drive visibility and alignment by championing the importance of a unified product expression across the company.
  
  

Present frameworks, updates, and guidelines that help XFN partners apply the system effectively and maintain visual cohesion.
  
  

Own how the product shows up by guiding how OpenAI’s products are represented across key channels, including web, campaigns, OOH, print, and video.
  
  

Establish scalable templates, systems, and visual standards that enable other teams to move quickly while staying on brand.
  
  

Contribute to brand system evolution by collaborating with brand leadership to evolve OpenAI’s core visual language.
  
  

Explore expressive ways to communicate the personality of our products through typography, color, motion, and layout.
  
  

Design and execute brand assets by creating high\-quality visual work for campaigns, launches, and ongoing marketing initiatives.
  
  

Maintain a high bar for craft, clarity, and consistency across all deliverables.
  
  

Steward brand identity and quality by upholding and apply brand guidelines across internal and external\-facing work.
  
  

Ensure visual consistency and quality across all touch points.
  
  

Support brand operations and scale by contributing to brand documentation, toolkits, and internal resources.
  
  

Provide feedback, creative direction, and design support to help teams work efficiently and on brand.
  
  

You might thrive in this role if you
  
  

Have 4\+ years of experience in creating comprehensive design systems across various touch points, including communications, marketing, and product design.
  
  

Possess skills in design areas such as motion, illustration, typography, writing for design, photography, and data information visualization.
  
  

Are able to create brand systems, behaviors, and design solutions with a high level of craftsmanship.
  
  

Have innovative design thinking across a range of communication and marketing touch points.
  
  

Work collaboratively, balancing the needs of stakeholders and simplifying complex ideas into compelling concepts.
  
  

Have a deep appreciation for aesthetics, user experience, and the ethical aspects of design in AI.
  
  

Are an adaptable, quick learner, comfortable in a fast\-paced, ambiguous environment.
  
  

Demonstrate detail\-oriented work, from concept to final output.
  
  

Enjoy collaborating with creatives, researchers, product managers, product marketers, and engineers to serve a global audience.

About the role

Start with an objective and turn it into a sharp, insights\-driven go\-to\-market strategy.

Partner with designers, writers, and creative teams to push the work from great to impactful.
  
  

Use product data and user feedback to learn what’s working, what’s not, and where the next opportunity is – then evolve the strategy.

Are a creative at heart. You inspire people to do their best work, you know great ideas when you see them, and how to push teams toward braver, sharper communication. You approach every task – whether it's a brief, a deck or written feedback – as an opportunity to apply your craft.
  
  

Can take something complex and make it feel simple, human, and emotionally clear.
  
  

Don’t necessarily have a tech background, but have experience taking a product, finding what makes it magical, and telling a brand story around it.
  
  

**Think in systems:** you naturally connect product, brand, channels, and user experience into one cohesive story.
  
  

Have a track record of building campaigns or launches that didn’t just ship – they changed how people saw or used a product.
  
  

Are comfortable working across disciplines (product, research, brand, creative, growth) and turning many perspectives into one strong point of view.
  
  

Have 10\+ years of experience in consumer, product, or brand\-driven marketing in tech, entertainment, or a beloved consumer product.

Backed by Bessemer Venture Partners and other top investors, we're a Series C company on track to hit $100M in annual recurring revenue in the next six months. More than 70,000 real estate professionals, including over 30% of the top\-ranked agents in the world, use us to run and grow their business. **Why This Role Matters**  

Our internal creative team is the engine behind how Luxury Presence shows up in the market. Every ad, landing page, video, and brand touchpoint runs through this group. The work is visible, high\-stakes, and directly tied to revenue.  

We need a leader who can take this team from good to exceptional. Someone who can establish operational discipline, build stakeholder trust, and raise the creative bar to best\-in\-class standards. This is not a role where you inherit a well\-oiled machine. You will need to fix systems, set new standards, and hold people accountable while shipping work that makes the company proud.  

You will report to the SVP of Partnerships, Brand, and Community, and lead a team of 5\-10 designers and motion artists. Your mandate: run creative like a high\-performing agency, not a reactive service desk. **What You'll Own** **Operational Excellence**  

You will build the systems that make the creative team reliable. That means clear intake processes, transparent tracking, and consistent communication with internal clients. The goal: 95%\+ on\-time delivery within six months. Stakeholders should never wonder where their project stands. **Creative Quality**  

You will set the visual standard for Luxury Presence. Every external\-facing asset should pass brand review before shipping. You will articulate why something works or doesn't, push the team to do better, and ensure our creative stands out in a crowded market. The bar is category\-leading, not just ""good enough."" **Scaled Output Through AI**  

You will implement AI tools and workflows that let the team produce more without adding headcount. Within 12 months, we expect 2\-3x increase in monthly asset delivery. You should have hands\-on experience using AI in creative production and be able to train others to adopt it. **Team Leadership**  

You will manage and develop a multi\-disciplinary creative team. That means hiring, coaching, giving direct feedback, and building a culture where craft and accountability coexist. You will rebuild trust with internal stakeholders through transparency and consistent delivery. **What We're Looking For**
### **Experience**

* xperience
* 5\+ years leading creative teams, with at least 2 years in a director\-level role
* Experience working at a high\-growth company as an internal creative stakeholder
* Track record building operational systems that improved delivery reliability
* Hands\-on experience implementing AI tools into creative workflows

### **Skills and Mindset**

* Strong creative taste across formats: ads, web, motion, video, brand
* Operational rigor. You build systems, enforce deadlines, and hold people accountable.
* Proactive communication. You over\-communicate status, flag risks early, and never let stakeholders be surprised.
* Comfort with cross\-functional partnership. You will work closely with Marketing, Growth, Product, and Exec teams.
* Ownership mentality. When something breaks, you fix it. No excuses, no finger\-pointing.

 **Values Fit**
This role requires someone who embodies Extreme Ownership and Relentless Execution. You take full accountability for outcomes. You ship on time, every time. You make measurable progress every day. **Compensation*** Base salary: **$180,000 \- $220,000** (salary dependent on role relevant experience and perceived impact)
* 10% annual performance bonus
* Equity
* Comprehensive benefits

We're seeking an innovative Senior UX Designer to help us expand Alexa's capabilities to help people lead healthier more fulfilling lives. In this role, you'll work with a blend of visual and voice interfaces to help customers access the information and services they need to be at their best—transforming technology used at home and on the go into intuitive, personal experiences.  

  

Key job responsibilities  

In this role, you'll lead the end\-to\-end design process for complex features and products—starting with early\-stage design concepts that help stakeholders and leaders deeply understand the customer experience while collaborating with engineers throughout the design process.  

  

You'll routinely partner with designers across Alexa to both adopt and extend existing design systems. As you develop new patterns and uncover best practices, you'll contribute to Figma libraries and share what you've learned with the team.
  

  

You will also be responsible for incorporating insights from relevant Alexa research, conducting hallway testing, and running user research with Dscout to inform and validate your decisions.  

  

Along the way, you'll partner with peer designers, product and tech owners, marketing, solutions architects, and business development to be sure the customer remains at the center of our decision\-making. This role will provide opportunities to expand your skills, practice growing your influence, and delivering best\-in\-class experiences for both businesses and end customers.  

  

A day in the life

You'll design net\-new concepts that make life more enjoyable for our customers, dream up new ways of solving long\-standing problems, and partner with solutions architects, tech teams, and business development to refine our product offerings and secure new commitments from our business partners. One week you might run user research to test how customers interpret and respond to the experience you're designing while another week you might partner with a solutions architect to build a working prototype for a conversational experience. No matter what, you'll operate with ownership and autonomy throughout your day.  

  

About the team

Customers have told us: 'You have saved lives' and ‘helped our residents connect with their families.’ Our team values work\-life harmony and a diversity of lifestyles and family schedules. We love solving ambiguous problems for our customers. We Think Big, Deliver Results, and Earn Trust. We rapidly create and deprecate mechanisms that help us be more effective and connected.

Shape the future of cinematic storytelling: for creators, by creators. We're seeking a founding Principal UX Designer to reimagine how premium video content is made using breakthrough multi\-modal AI capabilities. At Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, you'll be the design leader for a next\-generation video production experience that puts creative power of AI directly into the hands of storytellers.  

  

You’ll define the UX for a next\-generation, AI\-powered creative suite that blends art and science to make the impossible feel effortless — uniting ideation, storyboarding, character design, animation, scene composition, localization, real\-time iteration, and more in a unified workspace that amplifies, not replaces, human creativity. You’ll partner directly with product, engineering, science, creatives, and studio leaders to set new standards for AI\-assisted content creation and establish the design culture from the ground up. You will:  

  

* Act as a founding design leader with high ownership and transformational impact
* Have creative\-first systems thinking across complex, collaborative studio workflows
* Define patterns and scale design systems for global, multi\-user production use cases
* Operate from first principles; raise the bar for craft, simplicity, and creator delight

  

Key job responsibilities  

This isn't just another design role, it's your chance to define an entirely new category of creative tools. You'll lead design strategy for an end\-to\-end AI\-powered creative suite that transforms how creators bring stories to life.
  

  

You'll architect a unified creative workspace where human creativity meets AI capability. Think: intuitive interfaces that harness generative art, video, and audio to power ideation, storyboarding, character design, animation, scene composition, localization, real\-time iteration, and more — all while preserving the magic of storytelling. More on what you'll do:  

  

* Lead E2E UX strategy for an AI\-powered production experience from concept through delivery
* Translate ambiguous, technical problems and model capabilities into elegant, shippable designs
* Establish and evolve interaction models, visual language, and multi\-surface design systems
* Rapidly prototype (flows, wireframes, hi\-fi mocks, interactive demos) to validate with real creators
* Ground decisions in research: creator interviews, usability studies, and market signals
* Provide launch\-ready designs; partner closely with engineering through delivery/QA
* Present at the right altitude: from hands\-on design reviews to exec\-level narratives and demos
* Collaborate deeply with Product, Engineering, Science, and Studio leaders on requirements and roadmaps

  

A day in the life  

Your morning starts with a cross\-functional sync with Product, Science, Engineering, and Creative partners to review progress and discuss next steps. You’ll jump into a creator session with a showrunner or animation lead to test a new shot\-to\-scene flow, then refine interaction patterns that preserve expert control while enabling AI assist. After lunch, you’ll co\-spec UX for a localization experience with Studio Ops. Later, you’ll review prototypes with product and design peers, tighten micro\-interactions, and prep a demo for executive\-level leaders. You’ll wrap by pairing with engineering on implementation details for the next build.  

  

About the team  

We’re a small, high\-ownership “startup within Amazon,” formed by Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios to invent a unified, AI\-powered creative toolkit that accelerates how premium video gets made. Our mission is to empower creators with tools that are powerfully capable yet delightfully simple—preserving creative control while unlocking new velocity through AI. We operate from first principles, learn directly from working creators, and hold a high bar for craft, safety, and storytelling magic. If you’re motivated by invention and inspired by storytellers, this is your seat at the table.**BASIC QUALIFICATIONS**

**Overview**



Every year, people across the world spend nearly one trillion dollars on groceries. It's an industry that's been around for centuries. Food itself, however, has been a constant in people's lives since the beginning of time. Yes, sustenance is essential, but it's also much more than that. Food can be a part of a daily ritual or a special moment that resonates with people on a meaningful and emotional level. It can be a much\-needed break in a long day, a taste that brings back memories, a creative experiment, a shared meal with loved ones, or even comfort during a hard time. Whether it's a special occasion or an everyday occurrence, it should always be easy for people to get the ingredients they need.



The Instacart Design Team is dedicated to making grocery shopping effortless for everyone and finding solutions to large\-scale opportunities that will forever change the way people feed themselves and their loved ones. We're a four sided marketplace and design for the needs of Consumer, Shoppers, Retailers, and Advertisers.



The Instacart Design team focuses on designing, building \& landing multi\-platform product experiences that make grocery shopping effortless and create economic opportunity for our shoppers. The team crafts solutions for large\-scale challenges that will change the way people feed themselves and their loved ones.

  


**About the Role**



The Staff Content Designer, Model Design for CoreX is one of our highest\-impact roles where you'll shape how AI models interact with users across Instacart's core consumer experiences. You will view the model as the product itself, striking a delicate balance between maximizing the model's capabilities, reading between the lines in user queries to understand how best to help, and upholding user trust.



You'll embed with our Agentic design team and be part of the team reimagining the online grocery experience. You will collaborate closely with researchers to understand, predict, and design model behavior, while partnering with product managers, engineers, and designers across the company to ensure we're creating agentic experiences that solve and anticipate our customers' needs. This role requires exceptional taste, creativity, and writing skills combined with deep technical intuition to craft AI interactions that delight users and feel truly helpful.



As a general standard for all our designers and leaders, we are looking for people who thrive on building a strong design culture, lead with empathy and collaboration, and are committed to pushing the boundaries of quality and innovation in everything we ship. You'll be joining us in defining and evolving the newly established model design function at Instacart.

  


**About the Job**


* Work hand\-in\-hand with research teams to anticipate user needs and design AI behaviors that feel natural, helpful, and delightful across Instacart's grocery shopping experiences.
* Build alignment with cross\-functional partners—including product, engineering, and design teams—to establish a unified conversational voice that resonates with customers throughout their journey.
* Drive continuous improvement of our AI systems by synthesizing insights from user testing and designing rigorous and useful evals to identify high\-impact opportunities.
* Design and refine system prompts that enable personalized, scalable interactions, directly shaping how our AI assistants understand context, respond to needs, and create seamless shopping experiences.
* Develop innovative approaches to gathering training data that elevates model quality and ensures our AI truly understands the nuances of grocery shopping.
* Own the full lifecycle of content initiatives—from initial design through launch, measurement, and optimization—ensuring every iteration drives meaningful product outcomes.
* Establish and uphold Instacart's distinctive voice across all AI interactions, ensuring consistency with our content standards while making every word count.
* Balance multiple workstreams simultaneously, maintaining momentum and quality while navigating competing priorities and deadlines with independence and sound judgment.

Minimum Qualifications


* 12\+ years creating content for consumer digital products, with a portfolio that demonstrates mastery in content design, narrative development, and establishing design standards. Must include at least 2 years of direct experience designing AI model interactions.
* Natural storyteller with refined taste and strong writing instincts who creates user experiences that surprise and delight. Your expertise spans language, design methodology, and content systems, enabling you to distill complexity into clarity.
* Deep knowledge of how information architecture and visual\-verbal design work together to create coherent product experiences.
* Proven expertise in prompt engineering that drives personalization at scale. You go beyond surface\-level conversational polish—you architect the underlying instructions that determine how AI systems think, respond, and adapt to individual user contexts.
* Technical fluency to understand how data composition, training approaches, and prompt modifications influence AI behavior and output quality.
* Strategic thinker who bridges user research, product goals, and business objectives to create language frameworks and UX copy that solve real problems.
* Self\-directed operator who thrives in ambiguous, fast\-moving environments, making smart tradeoffs and maintaining high standards without close supervision.

We’re looking for a Senior Game / Visual Designer to join a highly confidential project exploring a new kind of narrative, text\-driven interactive experience. This role sits at the intersection of game systems, immersive visual design, and emerging technology, and is ideal for someone who loves designing worlds as much as interfaces.


You’ll partner closely with a small, senior team to define how players move through — and emotionally experience — a richly layered, story\-forward system.

**What You'll Do**
------------------

* Create immersive, “in\-world” interfaces that feel native to the narrative rather than overlaid on top of it.
* Design and document complex gameplay loops that support narrative progression, player choice, and state\-based outcomes
* Shape how players receive information through visual, textual, and sensory cues — including state changes, progression signals, and emotional feedback.
* Help define and curate guidelines for AI\-generated assets (portraits, environments, landscapes), ensuring stylistic cohesion and narrative integrity.
* Work closely with creative, design, and technical partners to ensure systems, visuals, and storytelling are deeply aligned.
**What You'll bring**
---------------------

* 5–8\+ years of experience in game design, interactive narrative, or systems\-driven visual design
* Strong understanding of diegetic UI and immersive interface design
* Proven experience designing complex systems, loops, and progression models
* Exceptional visual sensibility paired with clear systems thinking
* Comfort working with ambiguity and helping define new frameworks from scratch
* Ability to document thinking clearly for cross\-functional teams
* Major Plus: TTRPG literacy (D\&D, narrative tabletop systems, or similar) – Familiarity with branching narratives, player agency, and emergent storytelling is a big win.
**Pay Range**
-------------

* The expected pay range for this role is $61\-$78 per hour (on a W2\), but will depend on the level in which you are engaged
* Our company has three regional pay bands that it adheres to depending on your location, we reference them as US 1, US 2, and US 3\.

**Engineering Lead, Rollouts (Discover Group)**



We're looking to add an Engineering Lead to the Discover group, joining the Rollouts team. This role oversees two closely related teams, serving as the primary technical and people leader for one team while mentoring and supporting the second. You will be deeply hands\-on in the code while also growing strong engineers, shaping technical direction, and running high\-impact, highly visible teams across HubSpot.


### **About the team**



The Discover group is focused on how customers experience new value in HubSpot — from first exposure to ongoing adoption. Within Discover, the Rollouts team owns the systems and experiences that bring HubSpot features to market safely, clearly, and at scale.



Rollouts is responsible for the internal release platform that enables beta configuration, customer enrollment, experimentation, and high\-quality guardrails for feature delivery. We also own public\-facing product update experiences and recommendation systems that help customers understand and adopt new functionality. The work this team does directly impacts how confidently and consistently HubSpot ships value to customers, making Rollouts one of the most visible and high\-impact teams in the organization.



By joining this team, you'll work at the intersection of product delivery, release quality, and customer trust — influencing how hundreds of product teams bring features to market and how millions of customers experience change in HubSpot.


### **In this role, you will:**


* Lead two teams of engineers, acting as the primary Engineering Lead and technical driver for one team while mentoring and supporting the second.
* Be deeply hands\-on (50%\+), contributing directly to the design, implementation, and evolution of systems that power feature rollouts, experimentation, quality guardrails, and customer\-facing update experiences.
* Set and maintain a high bar for release quality, ensuring features reach customers safely, predictably, and with clear communication.
* Provide technical vision and leadership across release orchestration, experimentation frameworks, guardrails, and recommendation systems, balancing velocity with reliability and correctness.
* Foster an inclusive, collaborative environment within cross\-functional teams of engineers, product managers, designers, and analysts.
* Partner closely with internal product teams across HubSpot to understand their needs and enable them to ship customer value with confidence.
* Collaborate with senior leaders and stakeholders across Product and Engineering, operating effectively in a highly visible environment with frequent executive attention.
* Deliver value iteratively by envisioning, experimenting, building, and monitoring systems that directly impact customer experience and trust.
* Grow and support engineers through mentoring, coaching, feedback, and clear expectations, while holding a high performance bar.

### **You may be a fit if:**


* You have prior people management experience and enjoy growing engineers while staying deeply engaged in technical work.
* You bring a strong customer\-driven mindset, making technical and product decisions based on customer impact and quality outcomes.
* You have experience building or operating platform or enablement systems that serve internal product teams.
* You're excited by ownership of high\-impact, high\-visibility systems with a large blast radius.
* You thrive in environments where release quality, correctness, and trust matter as much as speed.
* You enjoy working closely with product partners to solve complex problems that affect many teams and customers.

### **Key Expectations for Engineering Leads:**


* Engineering Leads are player\-coaches who actively build software while leading teams. They remain curious, technically engaged, and continue to grow as technologists.
* They serve as the technical lead for at least one team, providing hands\-on leadership while supporting and mentoring additional teams.
* They establish a strong technical vision aligned with product goals, ensuring systems are designed to scale safely and serve both internal teams and customers effectively.
* They continuously push teams to improve technically, especially in areas of quality, reliability, and operational excellence.
* They work closely across Product and Engineering to align on mission, direction, and execution.
* They are responsible for the growth, performance, and success of the engineers on their teams.
* They foster diverse teams and an inclusive, supportive culture.

### **Why Join Us?**



At HubSpot, we're committed to building products that customers trust and teams love to use. On the Rollouts team, your work will directly shape how HubSpot delivers value to customers — influencing quality, adoption, and confidence at scale.



You'll have the opportunity to lead highly visible teams, make meaningful technical and product decisions, and drive impact across the entire organization while growing as both a leader and a technologist.



Join us in shaping how HubSpot brings innovation to market.

**State Policy Network**  

**Arlington, VA or Virtual Office**


**About Us (and You):**


At State Policy Network, we’re building an America where personal freedom, innovation, and opportunity empower *everyone* to thrive. We’re a national nonprofit—but more than that, we’re the connector and champion behind a growing movement of state\-based think tanks and partners working toward a freer society.


That’s where **you** come in. In this role, you won’t just be a spectator—you’ll be in the thick of it, working alongside bold leaders to ignite durable, state\-level freedom movements. Together, we’ll help high\-performing, independent think tanks make a real impact—one state at a time.


**How you****’****ll make an impact:**


SPN is seeking a part\-time, remote Executive Assistant to support the President \& CEO. This role is an exciting opportunity for a highly organized professional who thrives in a fast\-paced environment and enjoys creating clarity and order. You will be responsible for managing priorities, streamlining workflows, and serving as a trusted point of coordination between the CEO and those competing for time and attention. If you’re ready to help maximize the CEO’s time, and in turn, advance liberty across the country, keep reading!


This role includes a competitive salary commensurate with experience. Much of SPN’s staff are remote and this position is eligible to work remotely from a virtual office anywhere in the United States.


**Your Day\-to\-Day:**


* Manage the President \& CEO’s calendar and schedule, ensuring time is aligned with the CEO’s priorities.
* Oversee and prioritize the CEO’s email inbox, flagging important messages, drafting responses, and ensuring timely follow\-up.
* Collaborate with CEO to arrange travel, including flights, accommodations, itineraries, and logistics.
* Serve as an air traffic controller for internal teams and external partners seeking face time with the CEO—helping to balance priorities and manage expectations.
* Coordinate meeting briefs, notes, and follow\-ups to ensure the CEO is fully equipped for conversations with staff, donors, partners, and other stakeholders.
* Support other administrative and strategic tasks as needed to maximize the CEO’s efficiency and effectiveness.


**TLDR? We’re looking for…**


* Strong organizational and project management skills, with proven ability to manage complex schedules.
* Excellent written and verbal communication skills, with the ability to prioritize and synthesize information quickly.
* High level of professionalism, discretion, and judgment in handling sensitive and confidential matters.
* Comfort with technology and remote tools (e.g., Outlook, Teams, Zoom, Salesforce, or similar CRM).


**Are** **YOU a good fit?**


* Are you **Mission\-Bound?** Everything we do at SPN is in service to the restoration of individual rights and self\-governance. We pursue excellence in our work and set aside our pride and differences to commit ourselves to this end.
* Are you **Candid and Humble?** We give and receive honest and respectful feedback with the assumption of positive intent. We deal with problems and conflict directly with the individuals involved. We are open to challenges, eager to learn, and willing to acknowledge mistakes to improve.
* Are you **Entrepreneurial?** We seek opportunities, embrace innovation, and take prudent risk with a bias toward action. We test, fail small, and scale our successes. We’re resilient but also nimble, looking for the potential in every challenge.
* Are you **Relational?** Trust and respect are built over time through competence, reliability, and integrity. We establish credibility through meaningful relationships, demonstrating value before expecting influence or partnership.

* Maintain personnel files and support HR administration, including onboarding schedules and coordination
* Support benefits and 401(k) communications through administrative coordination only
* Assist with HR documentation, compliance tracking, and employee engagement initiatives as needed
* Track legal invoices and budgets, coordinate with outside counsel, and support trademark/IP documentation and filings
* Oversee office and facilities vendors, including janitorial, maintenance, and security
* Plan and coordinate company events, team gatherings, and offsites, including vendor logistics and scheduling
* Build light project trackers and systems to ensure clear next steps, accountability, and visibility
* Uphold confidentiality, organized records, and strong version control across executive materials
* Model Noodle \& Boo's culture of Mutual Respect and Kindness in every interaction

  

**Experience and Skills:*** Bachelor's degree required (Business, Communications, or related field); MBA preferred
* 5\+ years of executive assistant or senior administrative experience supporting C\-level leaders
* Experience in HR coordination or people operations strongly preferred
* Demonstrated mastery of complex calendaring, travel planning, and meeting orchestration
* Strong written communication and document formatting skills, including slides, briefs, agendas, and executive summaries
* High judgment, discretion, and comfort working with confidential information
* Proficiency with Google Workspace or Microsoft 365; familiarity with Zoom/Teams and expense/travel tools
* Highly organized, proactive, and dependable with a strong service mindset
* Comfortable handling a wide range of responsibilities, from executive\-level support to day\-to\-day office needs

<p>At DevRev, weâre building the future of work with <strong>Computer</strong> â your AI teammate.</p>
<p>Computer is not just another tool. Itâs built on the belief that the future of work should be about genuine human connection and collaboration â not piling on more apps.<br>Computer is the best kind of teammate: it amplifies your strengths, takes repetition and frustration out of your day, and gives you more time and energy to do your best work.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Easy: itâs the only platform capable ofâ¦<br><br><strong>Complete data unification<br></strong>Most AI products focus on either structured data (like CRM records and support tickets), or unstructured data (like documents and emails). Computer AirSync connects everything, unifying all your data sources (like Google Workspace, Jira, Notion) into one AI-ready source of truth: Computer Memory.<br><br><strong>Powerful search, reasoning, and action<br></strong>Once connected to all your tools and apps, Computer is embedded in your full business context. It can find and summarize, sure. Even more impressive: it offers employees insights, strategic and proactive suggestions, plus powerful agentic actions.</p>
<p><strong>Extensions for your teams and customers<br></strong>Computer doesnât make you choose between new software and old. Its AI-native platform lets you extend existing tools with sophisticated apps and agents. So your teams â and your customers â can take action, seamlessly. These agents work alongside you: updating workflows, coordinating across teams, and syncing back to your systems.</p>
<p>This isnât just software. Computer brings&nbsp;<em>people</em> back together, breaking down silos and ushering in the future of teamwork, through human-AI collaboration. Stop managing software. Stop wasting time. Start solving bigger problems, building better products, and making your customers happier.</p>
<p>We call this Team Intelligence. Itâs why DevRev exists.</p>
<p>Trusted by global companies across multiple industries, DevRev is backed by Khosla Ventures and Mayfield, with $150M+ raised. We are 650+ people, across eight global offices.</p></div><div><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>
