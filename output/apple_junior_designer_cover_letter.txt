Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Junior Graphic Designer position at Apple. With a fresh perspective in design and demonstrated expertise in Figma, Adobe Creative Suite, and motion graphics, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Apple's world-class design team.

My experience aligns perfectly with the role's requirements:

• As a Brand Designer at D.W Brand Design Services, I leveraged Figma and the complete Adobe Creative Suite to create dynamic brand identities and motion graphics that increased client engagement by 50%. This experience has honed my ability to maintain exceptional quality while working on multiple projects—a skill essential for Apple's fast-paced environment.

• At Ryerson, I led the UI design process for their new client-facing storefront, demonstrating my ability to create intuitive, user-centered designs. My work with motion graphics and digital marketing campaigns contributed to an 80% increase in web engagement, showcasing my capability to create compelling visual experiences that resonate with users.

• My recent graduation with a BS in Multimedia Design, combined with my practical experience, positions me to bring both technical proficiency and fresh creative perspectives to Apple's design team. My academic focus on motion graphics and brand identity design has prepared me to contribute immediately to your team's objectives.

What draws me to Apple is not just its legendary design heritage, but its commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible through innovative design solutions. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work on projects that millions of people will interact with daily, creating experiences that are both beautiful and intuitive.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills in motion graphics, brand design, and digital tools could contribute to Apple's design initiatives. Thank you for considering my application.
