Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Visual Designer position at Airbnb. With my background in brand design, motion graphics, and expertise in Figma, I am eager to contribute to Airbnb's mission of creating a world where anyone can belong anywhere through compelling visual storytelling and inclusive design.

My experience aligns strongly with Airbnb's design needs:

• As a Brand Designer, I've used Figma to create cohesive visual experiences that increased engagement by 50%. This experience has taught me the importance of designing with empathy and understanding how visual elements can create emotional connections – a crucial aspect of Airbnb's design philosophy.

• At Ryerson, I led the UI design process for their e-commerce platform, resulting in an 80% increase in web engagement. This project demonstrated my ability to balance aesthetic excellence with user-centered design principles, ensuring that beautiful designs also deliver meaningful experiences.

• My work across various projects has honed my skills in motion graphics and visual storytelling, allowing me to create dynamic content that resonates with diverse audiences while maintaining brand consistency – skills that would be valuable in bringing Airbnb's brand to life across different touchpoints.

What draws me to Airbnb is not just its stunning visual design, but its commitment to creating authentic connections through thoughtful, inclusive experiences. I am particularly inspired by how Airbnb uses design to break down barriers and create a sense of belonging for users worldwide.

My combination of technical skills in Figma and motion graphics, along with my passion for creating emotionally resonant designs, positions me to contribute meaningfully to Airbnb's design team. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and creative vision align with Airbnb's design goals.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Deanna Wiley
